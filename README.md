# 🔥 Daily Grind of Pain & Suffering (aka DSA Practice) 💀

## What's This Dumpster Fire? 🗑️

Yo, welcome to my personal hell where I solve coding problems every single day like my life depends on it (spoiler: my placement does) 😭

This repo is basically my diary of getting absolutely *destroyed* by questions that some sadistic developer thought would be "fun" to solve. If you're here, you're probably procrastinating your own practice. Nice. 👍

## Why Am I Doing This? 🤔

Because apparently showing your face in class isn't enough anymore. Now we gotta "prove ourselves" by solving imaginary problems that'll definitely help me in real life when I'm copy-pasting from Stack Overflow at my job 💼✨

Also because:
- My future self will thank me (or curse me, idk) 🙏
- Placements be looking scarier than my relationship status 📉
- Gotta show off those green squares on GitHub like I'm some kinda productive member of society (Some dumbf*** kids really think making this squares will get them a job)🟩
- LinkedIn influencers won't shut up about "consistency" 🤡

## The Brutal Truth 😤

Listen up buttercup 🌸, this ain't some fancy tutorial repo with clean code and explanations. This is raw, unfiltered struggle. Some days the code works, some days I work, most days neither of us do. 

You'll find:
- ✅ Solutions that somehow work (black magic? probably)
- ❌ Solutions that definitely don't work but I'm too tired to fix
- 😭 Comments like "WHY DOESN'T THIS WORK" and "I HATE RECURSION"
- 🤡 Code that would make any senior dev cry
- 💩 Variable names like `x`, `y`, `bruh`, `temp123` because naming things is hard

## Daily Commitment (or Delusion?) 📅

I'm committing to this repo daily like it's a toxic relationship I can't leave. Every. Single. Day. Even when I:
- Have 3 assignments due 📚
- Haven't slept in 29 hours ⏰
- Question all my life choices 🌀
- Want to switch to CA and deal with numbers that actually make sense 🧮

## What You'll Find Here 🎯

Basically me getting humbled by:
- **Easy Problems**: That somehow take me 2 hours because I can't read properly 🤓
- **Medium Problems**: Where I spend more time Googling than coding 🔍
- **Hard Problems**: HAHAHAHA nice try, I skip those bad boys faster than my crush skips my texts 📱💔

## Progress So Far 📊

Day 1: "I got this! 💪"  
Day 7: "This isn't so bad 😊"  
Day 15: "Why did I start this 😐"  
Day 30: "I've forgotten what grass feels like 🌱"  
Day 50: *incomprehensible screaming* 😵‍💫  
Current Day: Help. 🆘

## Rules I Set (And Will Probably Break) 📜

1. One commit per day minimum (even if it's trash) 🗑️
2. No skipping days (depression isn't an excuse apparently) 😔
3. Actually try to solve before Googling (lasted 3 days) 🤷
4. Comment your code (HAHA good one) 💀
5. Learn from mistakes (still making the same ones tho) 🔄

## Useful Resources (That I Found While Procrastinating) 🔗

Honestly just go watch some guy on YouTube explain it in 10 minutes instead of reading boring articles for 2 hours. Work smarter not harder bestie 🧠✨

## Stats That Nobody Asked For 📈

- Days survived: *counting...*
- Mental breakdowns: Yes ✅
- Coffee consumed: Too much ☕☕☕
- Sleep schedule: What's that? 😴
- Imposter syndrome level: MAX 🎚️
- Times I've questioned my degree: Daily 🎓

## Wanna Contribute? 🤝

Bruh if you're better than me at this just fork it and show off idc 😒

But real talk, if you got better solutions or wanna roast my code, PRs are welcome. Let's suffer together fam 🫂

## Final Words 💭

If you made it this far, you got too much free time. Go solve some problems instead of reading my trauma dump 😤

Remember: Every expert was once a noob who refused to quit (or was too stubborn to admit defeat) 🏆

Now get outta here and go practice. These problems won't solve themselves. Trust me, I've tried waiting. 🕐

*"In the end, we only regret the problems we didn't solve"* - Someone who definitely wasn't talking about DSA but we're gonna pretend they were 🎭

**Last Updated:** Whenever I remember to update this (so never) 🤷‍♂️

**Status:** Alive (barely) 💀  
**Motivation:** Running on fumes and existential dread ⛽😰  
**Will to live:** Inversely proportional to problem difficulty 📉

Peace out ✌️ Now lemme get back to pretending I understand Big O notation 🤪
